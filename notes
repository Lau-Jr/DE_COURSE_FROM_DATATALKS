pyarrow is required for read parquet data or fastparquet for fastparquest engine option
for some reason roor user specified in postgresql docker doesn't work
and for postgres we need pyscopg2 or psycopg2-binary


-----another day------
how do I actually put data to db from df???
I will use to_sql method in pandas 
this method takes 
table name,con and if_exists parameters


--------end of week1 summary----
so inorder to connect pgadmin container with postgresql db container they have to be on the same networks.
that is pg-network
which can be created by command 

docker network create pg-network
docker network ls ---to list of networks.

then they can be run seperately or using docker-compose.yaml file

but you must also assign --network=your_network in the docker cmd

like docker run -it \
	--network=your_network
